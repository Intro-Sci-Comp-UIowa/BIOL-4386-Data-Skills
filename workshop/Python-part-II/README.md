This folder contains two workshops. The machine learning workshop was developed by Cory Kromer-Edwards based on his research interest. The writing good code workshop was based on Stefano Allesina's "Computing Skills for Biologists" textbook. Another student of this year's class, Austin Wards, developed a similar themed workshop and is accessible through [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C86a2HQjqzkOJUelM6wdv6O9sZT64CFNksOtoCt-vuI/edit?usp=sharing). He also created a [slide show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rS5xj70H4M6r3-RTiaTdrHQKl1DmDnwXHFiBdFfYpTY/edit?usp=sharing) on this topic.
