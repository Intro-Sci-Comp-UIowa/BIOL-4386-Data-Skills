# Unit 3 Seeking Help
## Reading help files

For help in understanding what a function does, simply type:
```{r}
help(function_name)
```
This will open a help page on your bottom right window explaining what the function does. For example, if you type help(c), the window will explain that c is a function which combines values into a vector list
If you need help making with R markdown, there's a help tab at the very top which you can click and then click "Markdown quick reference"

## Special Operators
For help on these just put them in quotes:
```{r}
"<-"
``` 

## Vignettes 
Vignettes are tutorials and extended example documentation

## Finding a function 
If you don't remember how to spell a function name, R studio will fill it in for you if you have enough letters. ??pas will become ??paste
