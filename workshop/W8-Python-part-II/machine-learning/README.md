See the IPython-notebook for more details on this workshop. This workshop is developed by Cory Kromer-Edwards, a student in the 2021 BIOL:4386 Intro to Scientific Computing course at the University of Iowa, taught be Dr. Bin He. The data used for this course is from <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq>. To follow the workshop, go to this page, click "Data folder" next to "Download", and click to download the `TCGA-PANCAN-HiSeq-801x20531.tar.gz` file to this folder. After it is downloaded, use `tar xzvf TCGA-PANCAN-HiSeq-801x20531.tar.gz` to extract the files, and then move both the `data.csv` and `labels.csv` from the expanded subfolder to the parent (current) folder, and you are ready to carry out the workshop. Because the dataset is archived at the above website, the actual files are not tracked by the Git repository.
